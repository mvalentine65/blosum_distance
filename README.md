# sapphyre-tools

Bioinformatics tooling for sequence comparison, distance scoring, and reproducibility.

This project includes a collection of command-line tools and libraries focused on DNA and protein sequence analysis. Core features include scoring-matrix-based phylogenetic distance calculations and SIMD-accelerated Hamming distance utilities.

## Installation
```bash
pip install sapphyre-tools
```

## Features
- Scoring matrix support (e.g., BLOSUM62)
- SIMD-accelerated sequence comparison
- Tools for reproducible bioinformatics pipelines
- Built in Rust and Python

## Status
Actively maintained and used in research pipelines. Packaging and documentation improvements are in progress.
